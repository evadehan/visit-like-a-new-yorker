Title of the project: 
Visit like a New Yorker
In this project, I requested data from yelp API
for the following four categories: trader joe's, parks, museums and izakaya
Then I wrote data to a csv file 
Lastly, I used kepler.gl to visualize all spots

If you want to reuse the code, make sure you change the path and urls for api
